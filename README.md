Xcode 4 Designers
====
Thanks for checking out this project, and you've come to the right place!

The first thing you do is pressing Command+R to run the app and take a look at how it works. It starts from a Table View demo and it works as a menu as well.

You can also click the button next to "x4designer" on the top-left side to choose a device to run on.

TODO
----
Add LSwift as a submodule.
